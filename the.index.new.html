						<p>When all other burrito franchises claim a commitment to freshness and quality, what is it that places Jumbo Burrito in a league of its own?</p>

						<p>The answer is simple.</p>
						 
						<p>While they pre-cook their chicken breast and steaks for hours before they are served, we, at Jumbo Burrito, take the time to grill each order to perfection at the time it is placed. Furthermore, while they toast their burritos on flat top grills, which sometime burns the tortillas, we, at Jumbo Burrito, toast each burrito for a pre-set time on a pressure sensitive, state of the art, pre-heated grill. This allows enough time to thoroughly and evenly heat the inner burrito, which leaves each tortilla golden crispy and ready to be savoured.</p>
						 
						<p>What does all this add up to?</p>
						 
						<p>You, the customer, are guaranteed total freshness, and the highest quality and best tasting burrito or quesadilla possible!</p>
						 
						<p>In other words, "There is no doubt about it, our burrito can't be made to taste any better!"</p>

					<h1>About</h1>

					<p>Some people are driven to create the world's fastest cars or the world's tallest buildings. Our calling is only slightly less glamorous but a whole lot tastier. We were born to create the World's Best Tasting BURRITOS AND QUESADILLAS, which we proudly call JUMBO BURRITO. A mission of this magnitude requires an obsession for quality, and our homemade BURRITOS AND QUESADILLAS served on toasted tortillas with a choice of 21 toppings will gratify any hearty appetite.</p>

					<h1>Testimonials</h1>

					<div class="row">
  						<div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3"><p>"I tried a large bean and cheese and it was definitely enough food for the value (just over 7 bucks), especially with the giant potato stick thrown in!  I only ate half the burrito and was set for lunch.  Heated up the second half for dinner which was an unexpected plus. I was also quite impressed with the amount of toppings (I'm guessing there were at least 15). They add the toppings in front of you, so you can ask for more of anything if size is an issue. </p> 

						<p>Here's hoping this place sticks around.  The area needs more eateries, especially for all the Humber and high school students.Found this new burrito joint today and the coolest thing about them is they give you a free potato stick with every burrito.  It's like a foot and a half long stick of spiraled potato on a stick.." - D.A. (Yelp)</p></div>

					<strong>Catering</strong> <p>May we suggest that you make Jumbo Burrito's nutritious meals the core of your next corporate and social function? Yes, we offer, not only a delicious and healthy alternative, but also excellent value and reliable service for breakfast, lunch & dinner.

					<strong>Franchising</strong> <p>Although Jumbo Burrito just opened for business in late December 2013, with so many eyes that can clearly see that this concept can go the distance and, with so many smiles, which keep asking if there are other Jumbo Burrito locations, most are surprised to discover that this is our first.</p>

					<p>At this time, entrepreneurs looking into the potential of owning and operating a Jumbo Burrito franchise are asked to contact Clyde Viola at 416-354-2000 or clyde@jumboburrito.ca.</p>

					<p><em>The basic parameters of this new franchise opportunity will be a 10 year Franchise Agreement, with an additional 10-year Option to renew. Details of this Franchise Agreement are further outlined in our Disclosure Document</em>.</p>
